The project uses non-linear MPC controller for predicting Velocity and Steering
angle using Genetic algorithm as the Optimization algorithm. With a given trajectory
representing the driver intent, the controller has to autonomously track the desired trajectory by
controlling front steering angle and velocity of the car. The paper also discusses the cost
function, which takes into account of various terms like safety constraints which offers safe and
smooth travel for the passenger avoiding potential outcomes like motion sickness or frequent
braking. Moreover, the Results suggest that a nonlinear MPC control could offer a better solution
to Autonomous vehicles over the conventional PID control mechanisms. Simulation results show
the benefits of the systematic control methodology used. In particular we show how very
effective steering maneuvers are obtained as a result of the MPC feedback policy. Moreover, we
highlight the tradeoff between the vehicle speed and the required preview on the desired path in
order to stabilize the vehicle.
